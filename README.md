# TITANIC_LAB

Question 1: Loading and Handling Data
Purpose: You loaded the Titanic dataset (titanic.csv) into a DataFrame using pandas to explore its structure.
Key actions:
Used .head() to preview the first few rows of the dataset.
Used .info() to understand the data types and which columns have missing values.
Used .describe() to get summary statistics (mean, std, min, max, etc.) for numerical columns.
Used .isnull().sum() to count how many missing values each column has.

Question 2: Identifying Missing Data
You used df.isnull().sum() to identify which columns have missing data.
Insight: Now that you know where the missing values are, you can choose to:
Drop those rows (e.g., if too few)
Fill them using a method (like the mean, median, or a constant)
For Cabin, since most of the values are missing, you might drop this column entirely.

Question 3: Determining Survival Rate
Calculation:
df["Survived"].mean() gives the proportion of survivors (because Survived is 1 for survived, 0 for not).
Output: 0.3838 â†’ 38.38% of the passengers survived.
Visualization:
You plotted a bar chart showing:
Number of survivors (green)
Number of non-survivors (red)

Question 4: Analyzing Survival by Age
Result: The average age of survivors was about 28.34 years.
